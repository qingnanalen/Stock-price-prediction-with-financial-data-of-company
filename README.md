The project including dataset preparation and models implementation. The dataset of financial data of more than 2000 companies are in **"main.csv"**
The jupyter notebook file **"MarketPredictor(1).ipynb"** has the code for data preprocessing and postprocessing, models implementation, models training, and models validation. We have investigated a comparative study on MLP, LSTM, LSTM with attention mechanism(AM), CNN_BiLSTM_AM, and Bi_LSTM.
The jupyter notebook file **"Analysis (1)"** has the code to generate results including plot, tables, etc. In the very end, the plot of real vs. prediction has shown for one company with lowest error to demonstrate the performance of the model.
